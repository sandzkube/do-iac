# Deploy Multiple VMware VM with Ansible

## Description

Playbook and role to deploy multiple vSphere virtual machines from a template using Ansible. For more information, you can refer to the [related blog post](https://cloudmaniac.net/deploy-multiple-vm-with-ansible-on-vsphere/).

## Requirements
* Python (≥ 2.6)
* Ansible
* PyVmomi

## Configuration
The required files are:
```
├── ansible.cfg
├── answerfile.yml
├── deploy-kubernetes-prod.yml
├── roles
│   └── deploy-vsphere-template
│       └── tasks
│           └── main.yml
└── vms-to-deploy
```

1. Edit the ```vms-to-deploy``` file to define the number of virtual machines you want to deploy, as well as their names, datastore, IP and notes.
2. Edit the ```answerfile.yml``` file to set the correct parameter for
    * the infrastructure (where to deploy)
    * the common options for the virtual machines
3. (optional) Edit the role.

## Execution

```
ansible-playbook -i vms-to-deploy deploy-kubernetes-prod.yml
```

Enjoy! :)
